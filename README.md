# WEATHER SWEATHER

## Overview 游릭

Welcome to Weather Sweater: Your Ultimate Road Trip App Planner!

Are you ready to embark on unforgettable road adventures, basking in the perfect weather conditions at every destination? Look no further than Weather Sweater.
I have developed this back-end app that not only displays the current weather but also provides detailed forecasts at your desired destinations.
Utilizing a service-oriented architecture, this application seamlessly integrates a front-end interface with our robust back-end system. As a back-end developer in this App, my role is exposing the API that satisfies the front-end team's requirements, ensuring smooth communication and delivering a seamless user experience.
<br>
To bring you the most accurate location data, I leverage the power of [Mapquest](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/)'s geocoding APIs. 
But that's not all! We also harness the comprehensive weather data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) APIs, allowing us to present real-time and forecasted weather conditions.
<br>
With this Back-end App, I am using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) principles and the fundamental principles of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
<br>
So, get ready to hit the open road with Weather Sweater by your side. Let us take the stress out of trip planning and ensure you have the best weather conditions throughout your journey. Trust us to provide you with accurate, reliable, and timely weather information.
